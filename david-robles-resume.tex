%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

\section{Summary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Software Engineer with strong focus on tackling engineering challenges, writing quality software and
with strong grasp of software architecture, advanced software engineering principles and design
patterns. \\

I recently completed an MSc and PhD in Computer Science from the University of Essex, where I
conducted research focused on Reinforcement Learning, Simulation-Based Search, Evolutionary
Algorithms and Games. During this time I was also a Teaching Assistant in several courses in
programming and web application development. \\

I'm currently a Software Engineer at dotloop, where I work primarily as a Java backend developer
responsible for designing and implementing new features and RESTful APIs. In my free time, I love
programming in Ruby, Rails, Python, and more recently I've been diving into functional
programming.
